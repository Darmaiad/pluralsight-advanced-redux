# Advanced Redux (Pluralsight)
This project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Advanced Redux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flux-redux-mastering/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Installation
* Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. 
* Navigate to the folder that you/was created. 
* Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. 
* Finally, you can either:
  * Run `npm run dev` to launch to the project in development mode.
  * Or run `npm run build` to launch the project in production mode.

## Description
I updated the development environment of the project and created a production build. Other than that, this is basically coding along the instructor, with some code cleanup to match my preferences and some comments on tricky spots.
