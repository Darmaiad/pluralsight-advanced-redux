# Advanced Redux (Pluralsight)
This is a fully functional chatting application which includes public and private channels, along with personal messaging. This project was developed following the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Advanced Redux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flux-redux-mastering/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Description
I created an updated development environment for the project. Other than that, this is basically coding along the instructor, with some code cleanup to match my preferences and some comments on spots I found tricky.
